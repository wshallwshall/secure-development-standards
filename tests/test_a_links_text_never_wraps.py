"""No relative markdown link may carry a newline, in its text or in its target.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR. `jekyll-relative-links` is what turns `](CONCEPTS.md#a)` into the built
URL `/claude-multisession/CONCEPTS.html#a`. It finds links with one regular expression, transcribed
below from `lib/jekyll-relative-links/generator.rb` in 0.6.1 -- the version `Gemfile` pins through
the `github-pages` gem, which is how GitHub's own builder resolves it:

    LINK_TEXT_REGEX   = %r!(.*?)!
    FRAGMENT_REGEX    = %r!(#.+?)?!
    INLINE_LINK_REGEX = %r!\\[#{LINK_TEXT_REGEX}\\]\\(([^\\)]+?)#{FRAGMENT_REGEX}\\)!

In Ruby `.` does not match a newline. So a link whose TEXT wraps across a line break is not a link as
far as that pattern is concerned, and it is never rewritten. The `](FILE.md)` survives into the HTML
verbatim. Jekyll also copies `FILE.md` to the site as a static file, so the reader does not get a
404 that somebody would report -- the browser fetches the raw markdown and renders it as plain text,
and the `#fragment` addresses nothing in it. The identical link is correct on github.com, which is
where it gets reviewed. Same characters, opposite verdict, no error on either surface.

MEASURED, ON THE BUILT SITE, BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY PLACE IT IS VISIBLE. Built with
`bundle exec jekyll build --source docs` on 2026-08-07: 35 `href` values across the site were still
relative `.md` paths, 17 of them carrying a fragment. Every one had a wrapped link text and nothing
else wrong with it. 20 were in `docs/standards/ADOPTING-THESE.md`; 9 of the 35 arrived with the
citation migration in PR #16 and the rest pre-dated it. After the reflow that accompanies this file,
the same build emits 0.

THE TARGET HALF REFUSES NOTHING TODAY AND IS STILL HERE, and the reason is that the obvious summary
of the rule -- "only the text matters, the target may wrap" -- is false, which a probe page put
through the real build settled. Four links, one build:

    [text on one line](CONCEPTS.md#a)          -> /claude-multisession/CONCEPTS.html#a   rewritten
    [text that\\nwraps](CONCEPTS.md#a)          -> CONCEPTS.md#a                          NOT
    [text on one line](CONCEPTS.md#a-frag\\n-b) -> CONCEPTS.md#a-frag\\n-b                 NOT
    [text on one line](CONCEPTS.md\\n)          -> CONCEPTS.md                            NOT

The last two fail for a different reason than the first: `([^\\)]+?)` does admit a newline, and
kramdown is permissive enough to accept the destination, so the plugin matches -- and then looks up
a page whose path contains a newline, finds none, and returns the link untouched. A rule stated over
the link text alone would leave that path open while reading as though it were closed. Both halves
are one sentence: no newline anywhere inside a relative inline link.

WHY `test_internal_links_resolve.py` CANNOT SEE THIS CLASS. It computes github.com's rule against the
markdown, and github is the surface where these links work. It is also line-oriented: `parse()` hands
its scan one line at a time, so `INLINE_LINK` never matches a link that spans two. All 35 passed
there, silently, as links it could not see rather than as links it approved.

THAT BLINDNESS WAS LOAD-BEARING FOR A SECOND CONTROL. PR #16 banned any anchor into a heading whose
text contains `--`, the one shape github.com and kramdown slug differently. One of the 35, in
`docs/standards/DEPENDENCY-INTEGRITY.md`, anchored into `## Reject code you cannot explain --
assistance in reaching the explanation is fine` in `docs/CI-AND-STANDARDS.md` -- exactly the shape
that ban refuses. It passed the ban for the same reason it passed the link scan: the wrap made it
invisible to a line-oriented pattern. Unwrapping it made the ban fire on the first run, and it is now
written as the by-name citation `test_heading_citations_resolve.py` gates. Two blind spots stacked,
and the outer one hid the inner one.

SCOPE IS `docs/`, WHICH IS THE JEKYLL SOURCE ROOT. A markdown file outside it is never built, so the
plugin never sees it and the shape is not this defect there. Files are read from `git ls-files`, so a
document moved into `docs/` becomes subject to the rule without anything here being edited.

LIMIT: THE TEXT PATTERN REFUSES A BRACKET WHERE THE PLUGIN'S `.` ADMITS ONE. `[a [b] c](x.md)` is a
link the plugin matches and this scan does not, so a nested-bracket link text that also wrapped would
be missed. Measured on the tracked markdown: 0 link texts contain a bracket. The alternative is worse
than the gap. Admitting brackets means the lazy text run can start at the `[` of a `- [ ]` task-list
row and grow across the file to the next `](`, and the first version of this scan did exactly that --
it reported one "link" whose text was thirty lines of a checklist. The blank-line guard in
`WRAPPING_LINK_TEXT` is the other half of that fix: link text cannot span a paragraph break.
