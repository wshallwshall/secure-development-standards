# Tests

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

They are plain `unittest` classes, so no test runner is required. `python -m pytest tests -q` works
too where pytest is present; both runners were measured against this suite and both pass it. (No
count is quoted here on purpose -- one was, and it was stale within a day. The runner prints it.)
CI uses the unittest form, run from inside `tests/` as
`python -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_*.py'` -- that and `discover -s tests` from the
repository root find the same set.

**Python 3 standard library, plus one external tool: `pandoc` must be on `PATH`.**
`test_word_copies_track_the_markdown.py` rebuilds every published Word copy and compares it against
the committed one, so the converter is a dependency of the suite rather than an optional extra.
Without it, that file FAILS -- deliberately, and it does not skip, because a skip is printed beside
the passes and reads as one.

Prefer the pandoc version the committed copies were built with. A different one can report drift
that is not there, and the fix for that is not to edit the markdown. CI installs **pandoc 3.10**,
pinned and digest-verified, and the failure message prints the version it used.

Nothing here is installed by the tests, nothing is committed, and nothing outside a temporary
directory is written.

## What is here, and why each one exists

| File | Pins | The failure it exists for |
|---|---|---|
| `test_docs_do_not_drift.py` | the install block still exists where the pattern can see it and README carries no second copy that disagrees; every `blob/main` URL names a path git is tracking; no copy describes the installer refusal more loosely than the installers implement it | three ways this set goes wrong with nobody noticing. The procedure can exist in more than one copy, and did -- one page said the installers refuse when `$env:CLAUDECODE` "is set" while the code tests `1`, which is looser than the code and wrong for `CLAUDECODE=0`. Links leaving the site had to become absolute `blob/main` URLs, which converts an in-repo reference that a move breaks LOUDLY into an external one that a move breaks silently. And a doc claim about a control can outlive the control: the `CLAUDECODE` sentence was not wrong when written, it was wrong about what the code tests |
| `test_the_selector_matches_the_routing_table.py` | the interactive selector's YAML and `STANDARDS-REFERENCE.md` name the same items with the same status strings, every trigger token resolves to a question and option that exist, and the HTML-comment sentinel is identical in the markdown and in the layout | the same facts live twice, deliberately -- a reader who downloaded the `.docx` cannot run a web app. Two copies of one fact diverge silently, and here both halves keep rendering perfectly: the app shows one status, the printed table another, and the app is the one people will trust. Separately, **nothing in `tests/` builds the Jekyll site**, so if that sentinel line is reformatted the app stops appearing and every workflow stays green -- a silent failure with a green run |
| `test_internal_links_resolve.py` | every relative markdown link names a file that exists, every `#anchor` names a heading in it, and every link written as one of **this site's own served URLs** resolves back to the markdown behind it | these pages cross-reference each other constantly, and a link into a reworded section **does not error**. It renders, it navigates, and it silently lands the reader at the top of the page instead of at the section the link text promised -- so the failure is invisible from both ends. A rename breaks the same links the same quiet way, and `STANDARDS-LANDSCAPE.md` was split in two while this suite stayed green throughout. The served-URL form fell between two checkers: it starts with `https://` so the relative scan skipped it, and it is not a `blob/main` or `raw.githubusercontent` URL so `test_docs_do_not_drift.py` never saw it either. Those links are deliberate -- `WHICH-STANDARDS-APPLY.md` writes its third column the long way because a relative link is dead in the Word copy -- so they had to be checked rather than rewritten. It also **bans an anchor into any heading containing `--`**, which is the one shape github.com and the published site slug differently: github keeps both literal hyphens and turns the spaces around them into two more, kramdown folds `--` into an en dash and drops it. Measured on the built site, 766 headings compared, 19 disagree and every one is a `--` heading. This file computes github's rule against the markdown, so it passed all eleven of them; the ban is what closes a gap the slug rule cannot |
| `test_a_links_text_never_wraps.py` | no inline markdown link under `docs/` carries a newline -- not in its bracketed text, not in its target -- where the target is a relative path | `jekyll-relative-links` is what rewrites `](https://wshallwshall.github.io/claude-multisession/CONCEPTS.html#a)` into the built URL, and it finds links with a regular expression whose `.` **excludes a newline**. A link whose text wraps is therefore never rewritten: the `](FILE.md)` reaches the HTML verbatim, Jekyll has also copied `FILE.md` to the site as a static file, and the reader gets raw markdown with a `#fragment` that addresses nothing. There is no 404 for anyone to report, and github.com renders the same characters correctly -- which is the surface it gets reviewed on. Measured by building the site on 2026-08-07: **35 such links, 17 carrying a fragment**, 20 of them in `ADOPTING-THESE.md`. `test_internal_links_resolve.py` is blind to the class by construction, because it computes github's rule and scans one line at a time, so all 35 passed it. That blindness was load-bearing for a second control: one of the 35 anchored into a `--` heading, the exact shape PR #16 banned, and the wrap hid it from the ban as well. The **target** half of the rule refuses nothing today and is kept because the tempting summary -- "only the text matters" -- is false: a probe page through the real build shows a wrapped target is not rewritten either, by a second route, the page lookup |
| `test_prose_rules_hold.py` | the three banned constructions in `docs/HOUSE-STYLE.md` that can be matched without judgment are absent from every tracked page, and two measured qualities -- sentences over 30 words, table cells over 40 -- do not get worse than their baseline | `HOUSE-STYLE.md` stated the writing rules and **nothing enforced any of them**, so the only thing between the corpus and a slow drift back was whether a reviewer remembered a rule identifier. The design constraint is what makes this file worth reading: hard-fail **only** where a violation is unambiguous, because a gate that reddens a legitimate editorial choice is one people delete -- a judgment this repository already recorded once, in `TheBlufConventionHasOneSpelling`. So every candidate was measured over the corpus and every hit was read before being enforced, and **B-7 was rejected on that evidence**: "cleanly" fires 16 times and not one is the self-praise the rule bans -- `git merges both cleanly`, `a session that exits cleanly`, `an alias stub that resolves cleanly`. The rule turns on *what is being described*, which no pattern over the text can see. `B-10` went the same way on its single hit. The scanner rejoins wrapped lines into paragraphs first, and that is not a detail: `HS-14` wraps prose near 100 characters, so a line-based scan reported **zero** sentences over 30 words across 110,000 words, and read a line beginning with a wrapped "importantly" as a sentence opener. Both were observed here before it was rewritten. `HOUSE-STYLE.md` must be able to quote what it bans, so a table row whose first cell is a rule identifier is exempt -- that row and nothing more, or the rule sheet becomes the one unchecked page in the repository |
| `test_rule_ids_are_stable.py` | the `SD-<section>.<n>` rule identifiers in `SECURE-DEVELOPMENT.md` are unique, every identifier cited **anywhere in the repository** resolves, and no identifier that has ever existed has vanished without a tombstone in `## Retired rules` | the standard tells readers to cite these identifiers in their own deviations register -- an artifact this repository cannot see and cannot fix -- so an identifier has to mean the same rule forever. The scheme reads like a position, and during the session that introduced it a rule inserted mid-section pushed two others from `SD-8.5`/`SD-8.6` to `SD-8.6`/`SD-8.7`. Uncommitted it cost nothing; committed, the same edit silently repoints every citation of `SD-8.5` at a **different requirement**, with no error at either end. The historical set is derived by walking the file's git history rather than kept in a ledger, so nothing has to be remembered -- which is why `gates.yml` sets `fetch-depth: 0`, and why a shallow clone fails here instead of passing quietly. Semantic drift is explicitly **not** caught: that is a convention binding a person, stated in the document itself |
| `test_word_copies_track_the_markdown.py` | every published `.docx` is what `pandoc` produces from its markdown **today** -- rebuilt and compared, not scanned for headings | the Word copies are generated and nothing regenerates them, so an edit leaves a stale copy published beside a current markdown one. The scan that lived here compared the title and the H2 headings, so **prose** edited under a heading that did not move stayed green -- which happened, across three documents at once. Text comparison is not enough either: a heading demoted `##` to `###` keeps every word, and a link's target is not in the document body at all |
| `test_heading_citations_resolve.py` | where one document cites another's heading by quoting its title in italics right after the link -- `[Code quality](CODE-QUALITY.md), *Tier 1 -- durable controls, which carry the verdict*` -- that heading still exists in the target | the set cross-references by **title**, not by anchor, so a rename in the target leaves prose that renders perfectly and says something false. There is no link and no `#anchor`, so `test_internal_links_resolve.py` is blind to it by construction. It has bitten: `ADOPTING-THESE.md` claimed four documents carried a *"How to adopt this"* section after a deletion left three. **Only the link-adjacent form is pinned, and the limit is structural rather than lazy.** Widening to "any quoted italic" fires on ordinary prose -- 55 of the 107 quoted-italic runs under `docs/` resolve to no heading anywhere, because they are quotes like *"the gate passed"*. And the tempting fix, treating a quoted italic as a citation only when it *does* resolve, is circular: a renamed heading would stop it resolving, so the rule would stop calling it a citation, and the test would pass. That is a checker certifying its own blind spot. The distant form -- `[A](a.md), [B](b.md) and [C](c.md) each carry a *"..."* section`, which is the one that actually bit -- is therefore not gated here; its durable fix is citing a stable identifier instead of a title, as `test_rule_ids_are_stable.py` pins for `SD-<section>.<n>` |

The requirement is read off the **consumer** wherever possible -- what the checkers actually import,
what the gate actually dot-sources, where the installer actually writes its allowlist -- rather than
from a list of names typed into a test file. A copy list checked against a hand-written list only
proves that two lists agree.

## What they do NOT cover

Read this part. A test suite's blind spots are the reason a green run can still be wrong.

* **They do not run either installer.** The installers refuse to run inside an agent session, by
  design, and nothing here defeats that. So no case observes a hooks directory after an install. The
  evidence that a copy actually landed comes from `bin/ccx-doctor.ps1`, which hashes the installed
  substrate and the installed gate's helpers against this checkout, and from
  `install-git-hooks.ps1 -Status` / `install-gate.ps1 -Status`.
* **They do not test the installed copies.** Everything here binds files in this checkout. Enforcement
  runs from an installed copy that can be older, and a suite that only ever binds the repository's
  copy is exactly how a stale gate stayed green. The doctor is what compares the two.
* **They do not fire the git hooks, the claim gate, the push guard, the collision gate, the announce
  hook, the self-heal backstop or the ASCII checker.** The doctor attacks each of those against a
  throwaway fixture and requires it to refuse, with a paired negative control. That is a different
  kind of evidence and it is not duplicated here.
* **The PowerShell parsing is textual.** Comments are stripped before any declaration is read (a
  commented-out matcher used to slip through, and was caught by mutating the tree on purpose), but
  these are regular expressions over source, not a PowerShell parser. Restructuring a declaration --
  building the matcher list in a loop, say -- makes the extractor raise rather than quietly return
  nothing, which is the failure direction to prefer, but it does mean a reshape needs the test
  updated deliberately rather than deleted.
* **The `pre-commit` scan is line-oriented.** It flags a file operation naming `pre-commit` on the
  same line as the operation. A write split across lines, or one routed through a variable holding
  the name, would not be seen.
* **The link checks never leave the filesystem.** A relative link correct in this checkout still
  breaks on the published site if the page was not deployed, and nothing local can see that. Nor is
  link *text* checked against the section it leads to: a link reading "the leak gate" that resolves
  to a heading on the review-depth page passes, because both ends exist.
* **The cases that execute PowerShell SKIP when `pwsh` or `git` is absent, and a skip prints beside
  the passes.** `test_worktree_gate_no_args.py` and `test_a_cannot_tell_never_reads_as_an_all_clear.py`
  run real scripts against throwaway repositories, so on a host without those two binaries they
  measure nothing and say so quietly. That is the opposite of the pandoc rule above, and the reason
  for the difference is that pandoc's absence would leave a *published artifact* unchecked while
  these leave only a script that cannot run on that host at all. CI has both; a local run may not.
* **No coverage of the coordination installer, the allocator, the claim ledger, pruning, or the leak
  gate.** Absence here is not a verdict on those; it is absence. `presence.ps1` and `overlap.ps1` are
  reached only by `test_a_cannot_tell_never_reads_as_an_all_clear.py`, which pins their
  cannot-tell paths and the shape of the `-Json` row -- nothing about whether the liveness fence, the
  two-dot/three-dot intersection, or the worktree attribution are *right*.

Every extractor raises when it finds nothing, rather than returning an empty set for a caller to
compare against another empty set -- two empty sets are equal, and that is the shape of a test that
passes having checked nothing.
