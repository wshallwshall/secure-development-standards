"""Every relative link and in-page anchor in the tracked markdown resolves to something real.

WHAT THIS COVERS THAT NOTHING ELSE DID. `test_docs_do_not_drift.py` pins the ABSOLUTE links -- the
`github.com/.../blob/main/` and `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/` forms -- against paths git is
tracking. It never looks at the relative form, `[text](OTHER.md)`, or at an anchor, `[text](#a-
heading)`. Those are the majority of the links in docs/ and none of them were checked by anything.

THE FAILURE IT EXISTS FOR. A heading rename is invisible to a reviewer and silent to the reader: the
link still renders, still looks clickable, and lands at the top of the page instead of the section it
named. This is not hypothetical here. `docs/ASVS-ASSESSMENT.md` carries two anchors into its own
Part 2 -- `#never-score-against-a-paraphrase` and `#pin-the-corpus-and-stamp-the-version-on-every-
number` -- written in a session that renamed eight other headings in the same file. Nothing would
have reported it if one of those had moved. A separate session then renamed a `## In short` heading
across seven pages; that one happened to have no inbound links, which nothing checked either.

THE SITE'S OWN URLS COUNT AS INTERNAL, AND THEY FELL BETWEEN THE TWO CHECKERS. A link written
`<site url>/standards/STANDARDS-REFERENCE.html#some-heading` -- the host comes from
`docs/_config.yml` and is deliberately not typed here, see SERVED_SITE below --
points at a page in this repository, but it starts with `https://` so this scan skipped it as
external, and it is neither of the two forms `test_docs_do_not_drift.py` pins -- that file matches
`github.com/.../blob/main/` and `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/`, and this is a third host. So
nothing checked them at all. There were 19 such anchored links when this branch was added.

They are not a stylistic quirk to be rewritten as relative links. `docs/standards/WHICH-STANDARDS-
APPLY.md` writes its whole third column this way ON PURPOSE: that page is converted to Word by
pandoc and handed to a reader who downloaded it, and a relative link is dead in a .docx. The long
form is the only one that survives the trip, so the links have to stay and something has to check
them.

Measured rather than argued. Renaming `## Certification and program regimes` in
`docs/standards/STANDARDS-REFERENCE.md` reports four failures with this branch in place. Exactly one
of them -- the same-file relative anchor -- was reported before it existed. The other three are
served URLs on two pages, and they were silent.

CODE FENCES ARE EXCLUDED, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING. The first version of this scan reported four
broken links in `examples/sequence-adr/index-row-format.md`. All four were illustrative table rows
inside a ```markdown fence -- a document ABOUT the format of a decision-record index, showing what
its rows look like. They are not links anyone clicks and the files are not supposed to exist. A scan
blind to fences answers "does this text match a link pattern" when the question is "is this a link",
which is the narrower-instrument failure this repository keeps rediscovering. `test_a_link_inside_a
_code_fence_is_not_reported` pins the fix.

INLINE CODE SPANS ARE EXCLUDED FOR THE SAME REASON, and that gap surfaced the same way: by firing.
A file that DOCUMENTS a link has to write one, and `tests/README.md` describes the heading-citation
shape `[Code quality](CODE-QUALITY.md), *Tier 1*` in backticks. Relative to `tests/` that path does
not exist and never should. Fenced blocks were handled from the first version; single-backtick spans
were not, so the scan reported three false positives the moment a row was added describing what
another test pins.

ANCHOR SLUGS follow GitHub's rule: lowercase, drop everything that is not a word character, space or
hyphen, then spaces to hyphens. GitHub disambiguates repeated headings with a `-1`, `-2` suffix, so a
link to `#the-files-1` is accepted when `the-files` occurs more than once.

THAT ONE RULE IS ENOUGH ONLY BECAUSE THE TWO RENDERERS AGREE -- EXCEPT ON ONE HEADING SHAPE, AND
THAT EXCEPTION IS NOW GATED BELOW. These documents are read on github.com AND on the published
Jekyll site, each of which generates heading ids itself. If they disagree on a heading, a link is
correct on one surface and silently broken on the other, and pinning either rule alone certifies the
wrong half. Checked against the deployed page on 2026-08-07: `## 1. Five failure modes, and the
control for each` in `docs/standards/AI-ASSISTED-DEVELOPMENT.md` carries
`id="1-five-failure-modes-and-the-control-for-each"` on the site -- the leading digit kept,
character-identical to github.com's slugger. Numbered headings are the case most likely to diverge
and they do not.

`--` IS THE CASE THAT DOES DIVERGE, and this file was blind to it exactly as its own last paragraph
once warned. github.com turns each space into a hyphen and keeps the two literal ones, so
`### A completeness claim is a liability -- prefer "at least"` becomes
`a-completeness-claim-is-a-liability----prefer-at-least`. Kramdown applies smart typography first,
folding `--` into an en dash and then dropping it as punctuation, giving
`a-completeness-claim-is-a-liability--prefer-at-least`. Two hyphens against four.

Measured by building the site and resolving every rendered `href` against the ids the build actually
emitted: 766 headings compared, 19 disagree, and every one of the 19 is a `--` heading. It had
already bitten -- eleven anchors written into `docs/standards/ADOPTING-THESE.md` pointed at
`CODE-QUALITY.md`'s two `### Tier N -- ...` headings, resolved perfectly on github.com, and landed
at the top of the page on the site. `anchor_slug` below computes github's rule against the markdown,
so every one of them passed here.

THE FIX IS A BAN, NOT A SECOND SLUG RULE. Modelling kramdown's rule too would mean this file has to
track a second renderer's internals forever, and a link that resolves under both rules still has to
be written twice to be checked twice. Refusing the shape costs one rule and cannot rot: a citation
into a `--` heading takes the by-name form that `test_heading_citations_resolve.py` gates, which
compares TEXT and is renderer-independent. `TheTwoRenderersAgreeOnEveryAnchorWritten` enforces it.
