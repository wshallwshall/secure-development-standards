"""Pin the three ways this documentation set can go wrong without anyone noticing.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR. Publishing docs/ as a site turned two of these from theory into
something that already happened once.

  1. THE INSTALL PROCEDURE CAN EXIST IN MORE THAN ONE COPY. README.md is the front door on
     github.com, docs/index.md is the front door on the served site, and INSTALL.md is the
     annotated long form. A reader follows exactly one of them. When two of them carried the
     commands, nothing made them agree, and the first divergence was not caught by review:
     docs/index.md said the installers refuse when `$env:CLAUDECODE` is `1` (what all four
     actually test) while README.md still said "is set" (which is looser than the code, and wrong
     for CLAUDECODE=0).

     The two landing pages have since been de-duplicated: docs/index.md carries the procedure and
     README.md points at it. So the case below no longer compares two copies -- it pins that the
     one copy still exists where the pattern can see it, and that README does not grow a second
     copy that disagrees. INSTALL.md was never in this scan despite the docstring's original
     "three copies": it writes `<tooling>` as a placeholder rather than `"$tooling/`, so
     INSTALL_COMMAND has never matched a line in it.

     THAT INSTALL.md IS OUT OF SCOPE IS NOW A DECISION, NOT AN ACCIDENT OF THE PATTERN. It was
     unpinned because a regex happened not to match it, which is a different thing from anyone
     having judged it should be, and the gap is recorded here so the next reader does not have to
     rediscover which of the two it was. The judgment: placeholder-form instructions are a
     different artifact from copy-paste commands. Pinning them would mean normalising `<tooling>`
     against `"$tooling/` so the two forms could be compared, and that comparison would go red on
     cosmetic rewording that harms no reader -- a gate that fails for reasons unrelated to drift
     is one people learn to ignore, which costs more than the coverage is worth. It stays
     deliberately unpinned. Do NOT close this by widening INSTALL_COMMAND.
  2. LINKS THAT LEAVE THE SITE ARE PINNED TO `main`. Serving from /docs makes docs/ the site
     root, so a `../scripts/...` target resolves above the root and 404s. The fix was to rewrite
     those to absolute blob/main URLs -- which is correct, and which converts an in-repo
     reference that a move would break loudly into an external URL that a move breaks silently.
  3. A DOC CLAIM ABOUT A CONTROL CAN OUTLIVE THE CONTROL. The CLAUDECODE case is the live
     example: the sentence was not wrong when written, it was wrong about what the code tests.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. These cases read source. They prove the install block still
exists where the pattern can see it and that README does not carry a second copy that disagrees,
that every blob/main URL names a path git is tracking, and that no copy describes the installer
refusal more loosely than the installers implement it. They do NOT fetch anything: a URL whose path
exists here still 404s on github.com if the branch is renamed or the file is not pushed, and nothing
local can see that. They also do not check INSTALL.md's prose against the landing page -- it is the
long form and is expected to differ.

Run: python -m unittest discover -s tests

WHY THAT FORM, stated from measurement rather than from what the last person assumed. unittest is
stdlib, so that command works on every interpreter registered on this machine. That is the whole
reason to prefer it, and it is a reason that survives the environment changing.

pytest ALSO runs this suite -- `python -m pytest tests -q` was measured at 100 passed on the default
interpreter, which does have pytest. It is simply not REQUIRED: CI never calls it. Whether it is
importable depends on which python the reader has (three are registered here and one lacks it), so a
pytest instruction is a coin flip where a stdlib one is not. An earlier version of this line claimed
pytest "is not installed"; that was false on the default interpreter, and it was corrected by a peer
session that measured all three rather than trusting the sentence.

The single-module form works, but only from inside tests/:

    cd tests && python -m unittest test_docs_do_not_drift        # runs, 11 tests
    python -m unittest test_docs_do_not_drift                    # from the repo root: errors

These files import `_ccxtest`, which resolves only with tests/ on sys.path. From the root the error
looks like a broken test and is not -- that misreading cost one session four unverified commits.
CI runs `python -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_*.py' -v` (.github/workflows/gates.yml:196).

# "Where to start" on SECURE-DEVELOPMENT, "What it costs you" / "Not for you" / "Start at" on the
# landing page, "Why you should care" / "How to use it" on ASVS -- which is the same drift the
# heading spelling suffered, one level down. A reader moving between fifteen documents learns the
# shape once or not at all.
#
# The first and last are REQUIRED and the middle four are optional, because a router page has no
# adoption price and saying so in an empty block is worse than omitting it. "Not for you" carries no
# stop inside the emphasis, deliberately: it runs on into its sentence.
#
# THE THIRD SLOT MOVED TWICE ON 2026-08-11 and the second move changed the shape. It began as "What
# it costs you", asking for the price alone. It became "Cost/Benefit", asking for both sides, and
# the eleven blocks under it were rewritten rather than relabelled. It is now TWO slots, "Benefits"
# then "Costs", on the owner's call: a reader scanning for what a document gives them finds it under
# its own label instead of inside a clause.
#
# BENEFITS LEADING INVERTS THE ORDER THIS SET USED BEFORE, and the objection is recorded here rather
# than answered. Benefit-then-price is the shape of a pitch followed by fine print, which is the
# register this corpus is built against. What holds it honest is that "Not for you" still follows
# both and disqualifies the reader outright, and that "Costs" keeps every concrete price the single
# block named -- a split is not permission to soften the half that was harder to write.

    THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR, and it had already happened. Fifteen BLUFs answered the same five
    questions in three different vocabularies: `What it demands` / `Where it does not apply` on
    SECURE-DEVELOPMENT, `What it costs you` / `Not for you` / `Start at` on the landing page,
    `Why you should care` / `How to use it` on ASVS. Every one was well written and no gate could
    see the disagreement, because each page was internally consistent. A reader moving between
    documents was the only instrument that could, and only by reading all fifteen.

    WHAT IS PINNED. If a page has a BLUF, every bold PARAGRAPH lede in it is drawn from BLUF_SLOTS,
    they appear in the declared order, and the first and last slots are present. Nothing here
    requires a page to have a BLUF -- that restraint is TheBlufConventionHasOneSpelling's and it
    still holds.

    WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT PINNED. The middle three slots are optional. A router page has no
    adoption price, and a block that exists to say "no cost" is the padding the `B` rules order
    deleted. Nor is the prose inside a block checked in any way: length, tone and content are the
    author's, and PD-4's reasoning applies -- a rule that could not tell a good block from a short
    one would be a rule about taste.
