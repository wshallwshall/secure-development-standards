"""The prose checker. Hard-fail where a violation is unambiguous, baselined ratchet everywhere else.

WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR. `docs/HOUSE-STYLE.md` states the writing rules and nothing enforced any of
them, so the only thing standing between the corpus and a slow drift back was whether a reviewer
happened to remember a rule identifier. This file enforces the subset that CAN be enforced and says
plainly which subset that is.

THE DESIGN RULE, taken from the writing plan and not negotiable here: hard-fail ONLY where a
violation is unambiguous and the current corpus is clean. A gate that reddens a legitimate editorial
choice is one people delete, and the repository already recorded that judgment once in
`test_docs_do_not_drift.TheBlufConventionHasOneSpelling`.

WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE CHOOSING, because the choice is the whole design. Every candidate pattern
was run over the corpus on 2026-08-08 and every hit was read:

  B-7  "cleanly", "elegantly", "robustly"      16 hits, ~0 genuine  -> NOT ENFORCED
  B-5  "in order to", "utilize", "leverage"    10 hits,  1 genuine  -> ENFORCED, narrowed
  B-3  "Importantly", "It is worth noting"      5 hits,  0 genuine  -> ENFORCED, narrowed
  B-10 a heading that is a question             1 hit,   0 genuine  -> NOT ENFORCED

B-7 IS THE INSTRUCTIVE ONE AND IT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. The rule bans those adverbs "describing
this project's own work". Measured, every single hit was standard technical vocabulary instead:
`git merges both cleanly`, `a session that exits cleanly`, `an execution-alias stub that resolves
cleanly`, `a transform producing valid-but-wrong output passes cleanly`. The distinction the rule
draws is about WHAT IS BEING DESCRIBED, and no pattern over the text can see that. Enforcing it would
redden sixteen correct sentences to catch nothing, so it stays a review item. The same reasoning
retires B-10: its one hit, `## The one question: does failing it stop the change?`, is a question the
section immediately answers, which is not the rhetorical opener the rule is about.

B-5 IS NARROWED TO THE UNAMBIGUOUS FORMS. Bare "leverage" is a noun as often as a verb here --
`ordered by its own leverage`, `the highest-leverage gate` -- so only the participles and the
unmistakable phrases are enforced. The one genuine violation the scan found, a cloud program that had
`begun leveraging an external framework`, was fixed in the same commit that added this file, because
a hard-fail rule whose corpus is already red is a rule that ships disabled.

THE RULE SHEET MUST BE ABLE TO QUOTE WHAT IT BANS. `docs/HOUSE-STYLE.md` lists every banned
construction verbatim in its own tables, so a naive scan reddens the one file that defines the rules.
The exemption is deliberately NARROW: a table row whose first cell is a rule identifier, and nothing
else. Exempting the whole file would leave the rule sheet the only unchecked prose in the repository.

WHAT IS REPORTED RATHER THAN FAILED, and why each is not a hard fail:

  cross-file duplication   HS-3, but which of two copies should go is an editorial call
  table cell word counts   fourteen files exceed 40 words per cell, SECURE-DEVELOPMENT among them
  long sentences           a cap at 30 fires on 1,397 of 6,579; the long tail carries the warnings

Each is a RATCHET against a baseline measured from the corpus. It may not get worse. If it gets
better the test says so and asks for the baseline to be lowered, because a ratchet nobody tightens is
a number that stops meaning anything.
